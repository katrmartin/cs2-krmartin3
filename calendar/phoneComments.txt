You really spent _ hours of your time this week on your phone? Wow.
Sheesh, _ hours on your phone? Have you tried going outside and touching grass?
I'm not a doctor, but it's probably not healthy to spend _ hours on your phone in a week.
Your phone must be your best friend, considering how much time you spend with it.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize scrolling through social media was a legitimate hobby.
I bet your neck is getting a great workout from looking down at your phone all the time.
I hope your phone is waterproof, because you'll need it when your social skills start to drown.
