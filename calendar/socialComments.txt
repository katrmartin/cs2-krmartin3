You only spent _ hours on social time this week? You probably don't have any friends. LOL.

Only _ hours of social time... Even I get more than that and I'm a calendar. LMAO.
You really spent _ hours of your week on social time? Ever heard of a work-like balance?
You really spent _ hours of your week on social time? Sounds exhausting. I'm glad I'm just a calendar and not you LOL.
