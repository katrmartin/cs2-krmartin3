I hope you're not planning on getting anywhere in life, considering how much time you spend in bed.
Looks like someone's not a morning person. Or an afternoon person. Or an evening person. Or... are you ever awake?
Sleeping _ hours in a week? I hope you enjoy missing out on life and opportunities.
I hear sleeping all day is the best way to miss out on all the fun things happening in the world.
Congrats. You got an adequate amount of sleep this week. Hooray.
Looks like you're not getting enough sleep. Don't worry, exhaustion is a great way to enhance your creativity and decision-making skills
Too little sleep? Don't worry, I'm sure the dark circles under your eyes will come back in style soon enough.
Looks like someone's not getting enough rest. I hope you enjoy being irritable and unproductive all day.
Only _ hours of sleep in a week? Don't worry, you know what they say, 'Sleep is for the weak... and the sane'.
