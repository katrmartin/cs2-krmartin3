I bet your neck is getting a great workout from looking down at your phone all the time.
You only spent 7 hours on social time this week? You probably don't have any friends. LOL.
So, you work part-time? That must be nice, I bet you have so much free time to binge-watch Netflix.
Looks like you're not doing enough homework. Don't worry, failing is a great way to build character.
Too little sleep? Don't worry, I'm sure the dark circles under your eyes will come back in style soon enough.
